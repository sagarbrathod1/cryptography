The program will encrypt and decrypt messages using a simple code.

The program will read a keyword, insert them into a 5x5 array. If a letter is repeated in the keyword, it will only be used once in the two-dimensional array. Once the unique letters of the keyword are inserted into the array, the rest of the array will fill up with the remaining letters of the alphabet.
        
The program will then read the series of lines to either encrypt or decrypt.
The program will encrypt a lower case letter by reversing the row and column values.
The program will decrypt an upper case letter by reversing the row and column value.
The program will specifically process a file given to us.
